## ip_address.py
Script to output your current public IP address. Originally, this script was envisioned to run in a terminal window and automatically update your public IP address as it changes. I would still like to do that, but I will need to learn more about redirecting error messages while a machine does not have a public IP address.

## ip_calc.py
Usage: ./ip_calc.py <network address/CIDR>
E.G. ./ip_calc.py 192.168.0.1/24

Script to output the network address, first and last assignable address, broadcast address and number of assignable addresses.

## ip_working_calc.py
Working script to test changes before adding code to ip_calc.py.
